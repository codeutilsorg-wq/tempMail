## 💭 Should You Still Build Temp Email?

**Build it IF:**
- ✅ You're passionate about privacy/security

- ❌ You want "relative ease"
- ❌ You're risk-averse
- ❌ You need income soon

---

## 🚀 Action Plan

### **Recommended Path:**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Validate API Idea**
1. Pick one API idea (I recommend Indian Address Validation)
2. Build MVP in 4-6 weeks
3. Launch on ProductHunt/HackerNews
4. Get first 10 paying customers
5. **If successful → Scale**
6. **If not → Pivot to another API or try temp email**

**Phase 2 (Months 4-12): Scale to ₹50K**
1. Improve API based on feedback
2. Add more features
3. Build integrations (Zapier, etc.)
4. Content marketing (SEO, tutorials)
5. Reach 20-30 paying customers
6. Hit ₹50K/month milestone

**Phase 3 (Months 13-24): Optimize & Expand**
1. Reduce churn
2. Upsell existing customers
3. Launch second API (cross-sell)
4. Consider temp email as side project
5. Target ₹1L-2L/month

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Temp email is a cool project, but NOT the easiest path to ₹50K/month.**

**If you want ₹50K with "relative ease," build an API service instead.**

**Probability of hitting ₹50K/month in 2 years:**
- **API Service:** 75% ✅
- **Temp Email:** 30% ⚠️

**Your call!** 🚀
